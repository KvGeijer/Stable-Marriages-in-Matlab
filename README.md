# Stable Marriage in Matlab

The stable marriage problem is a fun problem easily solved in for example Java. But here I try to solve it in Matlab, just to see if I could. One problem was that I needed some sort of stack, so I implemented a Stack class, using an underlying Node class. This was quite fun as I had not used classes before in Matlab.

The big fail of this was that in the course we got given this problem, we also got a file with which to check the solution. However I did not manage to pipe data from stdin to my matlabscipt directly from the terminal in the way I needed to get the check_solution to work. If you know how to do, please tell me ;)
